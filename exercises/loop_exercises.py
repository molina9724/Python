# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Exercise 1: Countdown Timer (while loop)
#
# 1. Ask the user to enter a positive integer to start the countdown.
# 2. Use a `while` loop to count down from that number to 1.
# 3. Print each number in the countdown.
# 4. After the loop, print "Lift off!".
#
# Write your code for Exercise 1 below:




# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Exercise 2: Sum of N Numbers (for loop with range)
#
# 1. Ask the user to enter a positive integer, N.
# 2. Use a `for` loop with `range()` to calculate the sum of all integers
#    from 1 to N (inclusive).
# 3. Print the final sum.
#    Example: If N is 5, the sum should be 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15.
#
# Write your code for Exercise 2 below:




# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Exercise 3: Guess the Number Game (while loop with break)
#
# 1. Choose a secret number (e.g., 7).
# 2. Use a `while True` loop to continuously ask the user to guess the number.
# 3. If the user's guess matches the secret number, print "Congratulations! You guessed it!"
#    and then use `break` to exit the loop.
# 4. If the guess is incorrect, print "Try again!"
#    (Hint: You'll need to convert the user's input to an integer).
#
# Write your code for Exercise 3 below:




# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Exercise 4: Even Number Printer (for loop with continue)
#
# 1. Use a `for` loop with `range()` to iterate through numbers from 1 to 20.
# 2. Inside the loop, use the `continue` statement to skip numbers that are odd.
#    (Hint: Use the modulo operator `%` to check for odd/even: `number % 2 != 0` for odd).
# 3. Print only the even numbers.
#
# Write your code for Exercise 4 below:

# Advanced Exercise 5: Factorial Calculator (combining loops and previous concepts)
#
# The factorial of a non-negative integer N is the product of all positive integers
# less than or equal to N. (e.g., 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120).
# The factorial of 0 is 1.
#
# 1. Ask the user to enter a non-negative integer.
# 2. Convert the input to an integer.
# 3. Initialize a variable `factorial` to 1.
# 4. Use an `if/elif/else` statement for the following conditions:
#    - If the number is negative, print "Factorial does not exist for negative numbers."
#    - If the number is 0, print "The factorial of 0 is 1."
#    - If the number is positive, use a `for` loop with `range()` to calculate
#      the factorial and print the result.
