# Exercise 1: Simple Age Calculator
#
# 1. Ask the user for their current age using the input() function and
#    store the result in a variable.
# 2. Convert the user's input from a string to an integer.
# 3. Calculate what their age will be in 5 years.
# 4. Print a message to the user with the result, like:
#    "In 5 years, you will be [their new age] years old."
#
# Write your code for Exercise 1 below:

# Exercise 2: Circle Area Calculator
#
# 1. Ask the user to enter the radius of a circle.
# 2. Convert the input to a float, since the radius can be a decimal.
# 3. To calculate the area, you'll need the value of Pi. Import the `math`
#    module at the top of the file and use `math.pi`.
#    The formula for the area of a circle is (pi * radius^2).
#    Hint: The exponent operator in Python is **.
# 4. Print the calculated area of the circle.
#
# Write your code for Exercise 2 below:

# Exercise 3: Order of Operations
#
# You are given four numbers and need to see how parentheses affect the result.
#
# 1. Create four variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` and assign them the values
#    10, 20, 30, and 40, respectively.
# 2. Without using parentheses, calculate the following and print the result:
#    a + b * c / d
# 3. Now, using parentheses to change the order, calculate the following
#    and print the result:
#    (a + b) * c / d
# 4. Notice and think about why the results are different.
#
# Write your code for Exercise 3 below:




# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Exercise 4: Temperature Converter
#
# 1. Ask the user for a temperature in Fahrenheit.
# 2. Convert the input to a floating-point number.
# 3. Apply the conversion formula to convert Fahrenheit to Celsius:
#    Celsius = (Fahrenheit - 32) * 5/9
# 4. Print the temperature in Celsius. For an extra challenge, try to format
#    it to show only two decimal places.
#
# Write your code for Exercise 4 below:

# Exercise 5: Running Total
#
# This exercise will use an assignment operator to keep a running total.
#
# 1. Initialize a variable `total` to 0.
# 2. Ask the user to enter a number and add it to the total using the `+=` operator.
# 3. Ask the user to enter a second number and add it to the total.
# 4. Ask the user to enter a third number and add it to the total.
# 5. Finally, print the final `total`.
