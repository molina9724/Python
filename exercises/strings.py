# Exercise 1: String Basics & Type Checking
#
# 1. Create three string variables:
#    - first_name with your first name
#    - last_name with your last name
#    - favorite_quote with any quote (use both single and double quotes in different variables)
# 2. Print the type of each variable using type()
# 3. Print the length of each string using len()
# 4. Print all three strings
#
# Write your code for Exercise 1 below:


# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Exercise 2: String Indexing & Iteration
#
# 1. Ask the user to input a word (at least 5 characters)
# 2. Print:
#    - The first character
#    - The last character
#    - The middle character (use len() to find it)
# 3. Use a for loop to print each character on a separate line
# 4. Use a for loop with enumerate() to print each character with its index
#
# Write your code for Exercise 2 below:


# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Exercise 3: String Slicing Practice
#
# Given the string: my_string = "Python Programming"
#
# 1. Extract and print "Python" (first word)
# 2. Extract and print "Programming" (second word)
# 3. Extract every second character from the entire string
# 4. Reverse the entire string using slicing
# 5. Get the last 5 characters
# 6. Get characters from index 7 to 14
#
# Write your code for Exercise 3 below:


# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Exercise 4: String Methods Exploration
#
# 1. Ask the user to input a sentence
# 2. Print the sentence in:
#    - All uppercase
#    - All lowercase
#    - Title case (first letter of each word capitalized)
# 3. Count how many times the letter 'e' appears (use .count())
# 4. Replace all spaces with hyphens (use .replace())
# 5. Check if the sentence starts with "Hello" (use .startswith())
#
# Write your code for Exercise 4 below:


# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Exercise 5: String Splitting & Joining
#
# 1. Ask the user to input a sentence with at least 4 words
# 2. Split the sentence into a list of words
# 3. Print each word on a separate line with its length
# 4. Join the words back together with " - " as separator
# 5. Print the result
#
# Write your code for Exercise 5 below:


# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Exercise 6: String Formatting - Three Ways
#
# Create a program that asks for:
# - Name
# - Age
# - City
#
# Then print the same message using THREE different methods:
# 1. Using concatenation with str()
# 2. Using .format()
# 3. Using f-strings
#
# Write your code for Exercise 6 below:


# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Exercise 7: String Search & Validation
#
# 1. Create a variable with a long text (at least 2 sentences)
# 2. Ask the user to input a word to search for
# 3. Check if the word exists in the text using in
# 4. If it exists:
#    - Find its position using .find()
#    - Count how many times it appears using .count()
#    - Print all this information
# 5. If it doesn't exist, print "Word not found"
#
# Write your code for Exercise 7 below:


# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Exercise 8: Password Validator
#
# Create a password validator that checks if a password is strong:
#
# 1. Ask user to input a password
# 2. Check and print whether:
#    - Length is at least 8 characters
#    - Contains at least one uppercase letter (use .isupper() with a loop)
#    - Contains at least one lowercase letter (use .islower() with a loop)
#    - Contains at least one digit (use .isdigit() with a loop)
# 3. If all conditions are met, print "Strong password!"
# 4. Otherwise, print which requirements are missing
#
# Write your code for Exercise 8 below:


# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Exercise 9: Text Analyzer
#
# Create a text analysis tool:
#
# 1. Ask user to input a paragraph (multiple sentences)
# 2. Calculate and print:
#    - Total number of characters (including spaces)
#    - Total number of characters (excluding spaces) - use .replace()
#    - Number of words - use .split()
#    - Number of sentences (count periods, question marks, exclamation marks)
#    - Most common word (hint: use .split() and count each word)
# 3. Format the output nicely using f-strings
#
# Write your code for Exercise 9 below:


# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Advanced Exercise 10: String Reverser with Options
#
# Create a program that:
#
# 1. Asks user to input a sentence
# 2. Asks what they want to do:
#    - Type 'r' to reverse the entire sentence
#    - Type 'w' to reverse each word individually (but keep word order)
#    - Type 'c' to reverse only the characters (keep spaces in place)
#    - Type 'v' to remove all vowels
#    - Type 'p' to create a palindrome check
# 3. Use if/elif/else to handle each option
# 4. Use slicing, loops, and string methods as needed
# 5. Print the result with nice formatting
#
